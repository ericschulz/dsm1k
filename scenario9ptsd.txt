It had been a long time since I’d been out by myself. I kept thinking about it all morning, the thought of being in a crowd again, being around strangers, and I couldn’t shake the unease. I hadn’t been in a movie theater for years, but for some reason, today felt different. The anxiety kept creeping in, like a tight knot in my chest. I tried to focus on something else—but the image of people’s faces just kept playing in my mind. I made it there eventually. The lobby was crowded, but I told myself I could handle it. I kept my head down and tried not to notice the way my breath quickened. It was supposed to be something simple, an escape. But the air in the room felt heavy, like it was pushing against me. I stood in line to buy the ticket, but every little sound—the chatter, footsteps behind me—felt suffocating. I had to keep myself together. I don’t even know why I picked that movie, but once I was inside, I couldn’t settle. I kept checking the exits, my eyes darting around. I noticed people near me, too many of them. I tried not to let it show. I could feel the sweat starting to form on the back of my neck. The noise from the speakers made my heart race. I kept looking for threats, even though I knew there weren’t any. I tried to focus on the screen, but the laughter of people nearby triggered something. It felt like I was back there again. The sounds—the vibrations in my chest—made me jump. I kept telling myself to calm down, but it didn’t help. The feeling of being trapped, the threat of something bad happening, was overwhelming. I tried to focus, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The movie wasn’t enough to distract me. It was too loud. I could feel my muscles tense, my chest tightening. I just wanted it to be over. I couldn’t wait for the credits to roll, but every second felt like it was dragging on. I didn’t even remember what happened in the movie, just flashes of images. The moment it ended, I jumped up, rushing out. The noise, the crowd—it was too much. I just wanted to leave, but I had to keep moving. I couldn’t let anyone see how panicked I felt. I kept my head down and walked quickly to the exit. The air outside felt like a relief. I could breathe again. But it didn’t last long. I kept thinking about how I hadn’t felt safe in there. I kept thinking about how I just wanted to be anywhere else. I don’t know why I keep doing this. I want to feel normal. But I never do. It’s like I’m always waiting for something bad to happen.

I arrived in Berlin this morning for the conference. The train ride was uneventful, though as I sat by the window, I found myself thinking about how different this experience might be for some of my patients. The rhythmic swaying of the carriage, the distant hum of the engine—none of it affected me, but I knew that for someone with trauma, every small jolt could feel like a warning sign. A few weeks ago, one of my patients described how train rides triggered a reaction. She had survived a derailment, and though she was physically unharmed, the memories followed her. “My brain knows I’m safe,” she had said, “but my body doesn’t listen.” Her description stuck with me. As I glanced around the carriage, I noticed small signs of tension in other passengers. A man tapping his foot rapidly, a woman gripping her armrest a little too tightly—perhaps just ordinary restlessness, but I wondered. When the train slowed for a stop, the brakes let out a high-pitched screech. It was an insignificant sound, gone in an instant. But for someone whose body had learned to expect catastrophe, it could be enough to trigger a reaction—a sudden wave of panic, a racing heart, the feeling of being trapped. I made a mental note to include this in my talk tomorrow. We often think of PTSD as a condition of soldiers and assault survivors, but something as mundane as a daily commute can become a battlefield for the nervous system. Stepping off the train, I moved through the station with ease, my mind focused on my schedule. Still, I could see how overwhelming this environment might be—voices overlapping, people moving unpredictably, the sheer size of the crowd. Someone with PTSD might instinctively scan for exits, tense at sudden movements, feel the weight of unseen threats pressing in. For me, it was just another busy morning. I found a café near the venue and ordered a coffee, eager to review my notes before the conference began. The scent of espresso filled the air, the atmosphere warm and familiar. I exhaled, settling into my chair. Then, suddenly—a loud scrape of metal against tile. A chair dragging against the floor behind me. I turned instinctively. A sharp sound, unexpected—but my heart remained steady, my mind clear. Just a noise. Just a moment. But I knew that, for someone else, it could be different. Sudden sounds—car doors slamming, footsteps approaching from behind—could yank them into the past without warning. They might find themselves back in a burning train carriage, a war zone, a place they swore they had left behind. And that’s the difference. I notice these things, but they don’t grip me. My thoughts don’t spiral. I exist in the present. But for my patients, time doesn’t move forward. Sometimes, a moment from years ago can crash into the present, and the body believes it is happening all over again.

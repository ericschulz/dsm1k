I don’t know why I thought coming to the library would help. I told myself it would be a calm, productive day, but of course, it wasn’t. I should have stayed home. At least there, I can control things. I got here early, thinking I could get a good seat—somewhere quiet, where no one would bother me. But as soon as I sat down, my mind started spinning. Did I bring the right notes? What if I don’t get through everything? What if I fail the exam? I checked my bag three times to make sure I had everything, even though I knew I did. I tried to study, but my brain wouldn’t cooperate. My chest felt tight, like I couldn’t quite get a full breath. I kept thinking about the worst-case: failing, disappointing everyone, not being able to fix it. I tried to push those thoughts away, but they just looped back, stronger. Then someone dropped a book. Just a normal sound, but my whole body tensed. My heart sped up, my hands felt clammy. It wasn’t even that loud, but my brain latched onto it. What if something bad is about to happen? That’s ridiculous. But still, my body reacted like there was a real threat. I felt my stomach churn, the nausea creeping in. I told myself to calm down. You’re fine. You’re safe. But what if I wasn’t? What if something was seriously wrong with me? My heart was beating too fast. What if it didn’t slow down? What if I passed out right here? What if people stared? What if they thought I was crazy? I forced myself to sit still, but my leg kept bouncing under the table. I counted my breaths. I tried to focus on my book, but I wasn’t taking in a single word. My brain wouldn’t let me. I started thinking about everything else I needed to do, everything that could go wrong. I needed a break, so I got up and walked to the bathroom. But as soon as I left my seat, I worried. What if someone takes my spot? What if they steal my things? What if they think I abandoned my work? Inside the stall, I leaned against the door and tried to breathe. My stomach hurt. I hadn’t eaten much today because I was too anxious, and now I felt sick. I thought about going home, but then I worried—would leaving mean I failed? Would I fall behind? I forced myself back to my seat, but the rest of the day was a blur. Even when I was reading, I wasn’t really there. Just stuck in my head, worrying about everything at once. Now at home, I should feel better, but I don’t. I keep thinking about tomorrow. What if it’s worse? What if I never figure this out? What if I never get better?

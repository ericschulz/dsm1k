I almost didn’t go. I kept thinking about it for hours, replaying the conversation I had with Sarah this morning. She sounded irritated when I told her I wanted to go alone, but I just couldn’t deal with her today. Every time I talk to her lately, I feel like she’s pulling away. I’m sure she’s mad at me for not responding to her text yesterday, but it’s not like I wanted to ignore her. I just didn’t know what to say. I feel like I’m suffocating when I’m around people sometimes. I told myself, I can do this. When I got there, I tried to decide which movie to watch. There were so many options, and I felt this anxiety building up inside of me. What if I chose the wrong one? What if I end up hating it and wasting my time? I picked one in the end. The perfect one. Or at least, I thought it was. I hoped it would take me away from everything, but nothing ever does, does it? The movie started, and I immediately felt out of place. Couples everywhere. It’s like they were all there to rub it in my face that I’m alone. I hate when I feel like I’m the only one in the world who’s so different, so disconnected. It’s so stupid, but it’s hard to shake off. I couldn’t stop staring at the couple in front of me. I felt this sudden, overwhelming anger bubbling up in me. I was so angry I almost wanted to yell at them. Why are they so happy? Why can’t I have that? It wasn’t even the movie anymore. My emotions felt like they were taking over. The anxiety kept creeping in, like this heavy weight in my chest. I could feel my heart racing. I couldn’t breathe properly. I think I even started to tear up, but I didn’t want anyone to see, so I turned away. What if they noticed? I don’t know why I care, but I do. The rest of the movie was a blur. One minute, I was laughing at something, the next minute, I felt like I was completely sinking into despair. It’s like I’m always stuck in between these two extremes, and it’s exhausting. I wanted to leave, but then I felt this fear rise up—what if I missed something important? What if I regret it later? By the time the movie ended, I couldn’t even remember anything. I don’t even know what the ending was. I left in a rush, my head spinning. I couldn’t help but think about Sarah again and again, how I didn’t call her back last night. I should have, but I don’t know how to fix it. I just feel so lost. Like everything’s slipping away from me.

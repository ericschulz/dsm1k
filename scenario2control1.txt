Today was a lot. I wouldn’t say it was bad, exactly, but it wasn’t as fun as I thought it would be. I don’t know why I feel so drained right now. Everyone else seemed to have a great time, so I should have too, right? But instead, I just feel exhausted, like my body is still buzzing even though I’m sitting in bed.The theme park was bigger and louder than I expected. I knew it would be crowded, but I didn’t think it would be that crowded. The second we walked in, I felt a little overwhelmed—people rushing past, music coming from different directions, kids screaming, vendors shouting. It was hard to focus. I kept checking the map, trying to figure out where to go next, but every time I did, someone was already moving ahead, and I had to scramble to keep up. I tried to just go with the flow, but I kept catching myself getting lost in my own head. Like when we got in line for one of the rides, I started thinking about how long it was going to take, how hot it was getting, whether I should’ve brought a different bag, whether I should’ve eaten something first. Just small things, but they kept piling up. And then, of course, I started worrying that I was overthinking everything and that I was going to ruin my own day. At one point, I felt really irritated for no reason. We were trying to decide what to do next, and no one could agree, and suddenly, I just wanted to leave. It wasn’t like I was angry, but I felt this frustration bubbling up, and I had to bite my tongue to keep myself from snapping. A few minutes later, I was fine again, but I hated that I even felt that way in the first place. The Ferris wheel was probably the most uncomfortable part of the day. Not because I was scared of heights or anything, but because the second we got in the enclosed car, I felt really antsy. It was stuffy, and for some reason, I just wanted to get off the ride before it even started. My heart was racing a little, but I told myself it was just because I had been walking around all day. By the time we got to the top, I had calmed down, but I was still annoyed that I couldn’t just relax like everyone else. Looking back, I don’t know why I let little things get to me so much. Nothing bad happened. It was a normal day, and I probably just overthought everything. I don’t know. Maybe I was just tired, or maybe theme parks just aren’t really my thing. Everyone else had fun, though, so I don’t want to make a big deal out of it. I’ll probably feel better after a good night’s sleep.

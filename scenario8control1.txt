I woke up feeling a bit off. Some mornings just feel heavier than others, and that’s okay. I had a strange dream, about being stuck in a room with no doors, but it was just a dream. No reason to overthink it. I stretched, took a deep breath, and reminded myself that I had things to do. I decided to go to church, like I usually do. It’s a Sunday routine, something I enjoy. It’s not that I’d be missed if I didn’t go, but I like being there. There’s comfort in the routine, in the community. It helps me reflect, and that’s important to me. Walking in, the room felt a little dense. It always does at the start of service—people talking, settling in. I looked around and spotted a few familiar faces. Everyone was busy with their own conversations. I waved at someone I knew, and they smiled but quickly turned back to their chat. No big deal. People are caught up in their own lives, and I don’t take it personally. I took a seat and let myself relax. The sermon started, and I tried to focus. My mind wandered a bit, as it sometimes does. It wasn’t a big deal. Not every sermon will grab my attention, and that’s fine. I didn’t feel pressured to be fully focused. I was just there, taking it in as best I could. Some days, I’m more engaged; other days, I just sit with my thoughts. Both are fine. Someone behind me laughed, and for a moment, I wondered if it was because of something I did. But I quickly let it go. It wasn’t about me. It never is. People’s reactions are more about them than they are about me. I smiled, felt at ease, and let myself be present in the moment. Then, the pastor’s tone changed. He became more serious, and his words resonated with me. It wasn’t something that overwhelmed me, but it made me reflect on judgment and how it can impact us. I felt a bit of discomfort but didn’t let it take over. It was just a passing feeling, nothing I needed to hold onto. Without much thought, I stood up, deciding to step out for a moment. The doors opened behind me as I moved into the hallway, taking in a deep breath. The air felt fresh, almost like a reset. I wasn’t running from anything—I was just giving myself a moment. People would be coming out soon, but I wasn’t worried. I knew I’d be fine. Life goes on, and there’s always room for tomorrow. The sunlight hit me when I stepped outside, and it felt warm, calming. It reminded me that no matter what, I could handle whatever came my way. Today would be fine. Tomorrow would be clearer. It was all just part of the flow.

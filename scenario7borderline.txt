I woke up feeling empty. Not tired, not sad, just gone. Like there was nothing at all. I checked my phone, but there was nothing from Sarah. I know she saw my message. She was online last night. I don’t know why she’s ignoring me. I kept telling myself not to text again, but after an hour, I gave in. Still no reply. She hates me. She’s done with me. I don’t even know what I did. Maybe she finally realized I’m impossible. Maybe she’s laughing about me. I tried to start work, but my head wouldn’t stay still. I kept thinking about Sarah, about last week when she told me I “overreacted” about that thing with Mark. I wasn’t overreacting—I just felt things more than other people do. But maybe she was right. Maybe I’m too much. Maybe everyone just pretends to like me until they get tired and leave. The thought made me dizzy. My hands started shaking. I wanted to scream or cry, but nothing came out. I closed my laptop. What’s the point? I can’t focus when I feel like this. By noon, I couldn’t sit still anymore. I needed to do something, so I made toast, but then I felt disgusted with myself for eating it. I threw the rest away. I didn’t even want it. I just needed to feel in control of something. That’s when Sarah texted back. “Hey, sorry, just busy.” That was it. Just busy. That’s what people say when they don’t care. My hands were shaking. I wanted to scream. I almost threw my phone, but instead, I just sat there, shaking. I shouldn’t have texted her. Now she thinks I’m desperate. Maybe I should just disappear for a while and see if she even notices. I tried distracting myself with a show, but I couldn’t concentrate. My mind kept spinning. One minute, I told myself it didn’t matter, that I didn’t need her, that I was done. The next, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I wanted to call her, to beg her to tell me she wasn’t mad. But I also wanted to hurt her, to say something cruel so she’d feel as bad as I did. I hate myself for thinking that way, but it’s like I have no control. It’s all or nothing. I don’t know how to stop feeling like this. By the evening, I felt drained. I thought about taking a bath, but I didn’t have the energy. I just lay down, staring at the ceiling, feeling like I wasn’t even real. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know if I even exist without other people telling me I matter. Maybe I don’t. Maybe I’m just this hollow thing that no one wants. Maybe I should just disappear.

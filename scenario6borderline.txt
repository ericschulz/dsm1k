I’m still trying to shake the heaviness of last night. I went to dinner with Sarah; we used to be close, but lately, I’m never sure where we stand. I invited her, but part of me worried she’d cancel—she’s always so busy, so I think I must’ve come across as needy when I asked. She didn’t cancel, though, and I convinced myself that was a good sign. But the whole evening felt like a test. I got to the restaurant early, because I hate waiting for people. It’s like, if I get there first, maybe it’ll feel like I’m in control. I think I was nervous, so I ordered a drink while I waited. A little too much wine to calm down, I guess. Sarah came in right on time, which was a relief and a disappointment. I wanted her to be a little late, just to show that she was thinking about me. She looked different, but I couldn’t figure out why. I kept trying to make her laugh, maybe to get some kind of confirmation that we were okay, that everything was fine. I was getting anxious. It’s like I could feel myself losing her already. I kept pushing for more, asking about things we used to talk about. I felt like I was drowning in my own thoughts and couldn’t focus on what she was saying. My mind was spinning—what if she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore? I ended up snapping at her over something so small. She mentioned something about her job, and I thought she was ignoring me, or maybe she didn’t care. She said she had a lot of work to do next week, and I asked her if she thought I was boring or if she was just making excuses. I could see the confusion in her face, but I couldn’t stop myself. I hated feeling like I was invisible to her. I don’t know why I said that. It was like I couldn’t control myself, even though I knew it was wrong. The rest of the dinner was awkward. I felt this overwhelming emptiness in my chest, and no matter what she said, it didn’t fill it. I kept worrying that maybe she’d just leave. Maybe I was too much, too demanding, too intense. I even started thinking about how I’d handle her leaving, because that’s what always happens eventually, right? I think I might’ve started crying, but I’m not sure. It’s hard to remember, because everything felt like it was happening outside of me. When I got home, I wanted to text Sarah, but I was afraid she’d think I was overreacting. So I just sat there, feeling like I was disappearing. Why is it so hard? Why do I always feel like I’m just one mistake away from losing everyone?

I’ve been thinking a lot about how hard this visit is going to be. I don’t know if I’m ready yet. People likely don’t understand what it’s like to go through what I have. Sure, my childhood wasn’t perfect, but whose is? Still, I think I’ve suffered more than most. The weight of it all follows me everywhere. The train ride was exhausting. The noise, the people, the constant stops—it was overwhelming. I kept looking around, waiting for someone to notice my discomfort. No one did, of course. They never do. When I got off the train, my mom was there, all smiles, acting like nothing ever happened. She has no idea how hard this is for me. If she knew what I’ve been through, she wouldn’t expect me to come at all. When we got to the house, I hesitated before stepping inside. I’ve read that PTSD can make you feel like you’re reliving the past. I thought I might feel that way, but mostly, I just felt annoyed. The house smelled the same as always—like cinnamon and that weird old wood scent. I tried to let the weight of the moment sink in, but it just felt like any other holiday visit. At dinner, my uncle asked about work, and I sighed loudly before answering. “It’s been really tough,” I said, watching for his reaction. He nodded sympathetically, but I don’t think he really got it. Nobody gets it. When my brother started talking about his new promotion, I waited for someone to ask how I was handling everything, but no one did. I spent the rest of the meal picking at my food, hoping someone would notice I wasn’t eating. I’ve read that people with PTSD lose their appetite in stressful situations. I thought if I looked miserable enough, someone would ask what was wrong. But they just kept eating. It’s like they don’t even realize how much I’ve been through. After dinner, I went upstairs to my old room and sat on the bed, staring at the walls. I wondered what would happen if I had a panic attack. Would they finally understand? Would they stop treating me like everything is normal? I closed my eyes and tried to bring up something upsetting, but it was hard to focus. I just felt tired. Maybe it’s their fault. If they were more supportive, if they asked more questions, I wouldn’t feel so alone in this. But they never do. It’s exhausting trying to get people to see how much I’ve suffered. Sometimes, I think they don’t want to know. Maybe it’s easier for them to pretend I’m fine. But I’m not fine. I don’t know if I ever will be. I just wish someone would acknowledge how hard this is for me. But I guess they never will.

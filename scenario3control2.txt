The train ride home was uneventful, which was a relief. I had packed my bag the night before, double-checked my ticket in the morning, and left early just in case. Traveling during the holidays is always a bit hectic, but everything went smoothly. I listened to a podcast about mental health and watched the scenery pass by, letting my mind wander. It felt good to have a few hours of quiet before stepping into the whirlwind of family gatherings. When I got off the train, Mom was already waiting at the platform, waving enthusiastically. I felt a little surge of warmth—no matter how old I get, she always looks so happy to see me. We hugged, and she immediately asked about my trip. “No delays?” she asked. “No delays,” I assured her, and we walked to the car, chatting about the weather, our relatives, and how work had been. The drive home felt familiar, like slipping into an old routine. We passed by my old high school, the grocery store where I used to work summers, and the coffee shop where I spent way too much money as a teenager. It’s funny how these things never change. Mom asked about my job, and I told her things were going well. “You know Aunt Linda’s going to ask about a promotion,” she teased. I rolled my eyes, but I didn’t mind. That’s just Aunt Linda. Walking into the house felt nice. It smelled like cinnamon and roasted turkey. My brother was already on the couch, half-watching a football game. “Hey, you made it,” he said, giving me a quick nod. I dropped my bag by the stairs and joined him, stretching out on the couch. Dinner was the usual controlled chaos. Uncle Mark got a little too passionate about politics, Aunt Linda asked about my job, and my cousin’s kids ran in and out of the room, giggling. It was noisy and a little overwhelming at times, but that’s just how Thanksgiving is for everyone. I caught up with my grandmother, helped my mom set the table, and tried not to overfill my plate. The food was incredible, as always. After dinner, we all settled into the living room. My dad was in charge of picking a movie, and as expected, he went with something from the ’90s that nobody really wanted to watch but everyone tolerated. I curled up under a blanket, full and content. The night wound down, people started saying their goodbyes, and I found myself already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. When I finally got to bed, I felt a wave of tired satisfaction. It had been a long day, but a good one. Nothing dramatic, nothing stressful—just the usual mix of family quirks and good food. I know some people find holidays overwhelming, but for me, they’re always comforting in their predictability. As I closed my eyes, I felt grateful. Another Thanksgiving in the books.

I barely slept again. This has been going on for weeks and weeks now. Every time I closed my eyes, I was back there. The alley, the footsteps behind me, the cold metal pressing against my side. Even though I know I’m in my bed, my body doesn’t believe it. I kept jerking awake, my heart hammering like I was running for my life. It’s been months, but it feels like it just happened. I finally got out of bed around 9:00, but only because lying there made it worse. The apartment was too quiet, but I couldn’t bring myself to open the window. Too exposed. I double-checked the locks on the door, then checked them again. I know they were locked before, but what if I missed something? What if someone’s waiting outside? I tried to work, but the email notifications made me jump every time. Each little sound felt like a threat. My hands shook when I tried to type. I kept getting flashes of that night, clear memories of what happened. The way his voice sounded. The way my legs froze up. I should have done something, fought back, run. But instead, I just stood there, like a deer in headlights. My chest felt tight just thinking about it. I took deep breaths like my therapist said, but it didn’t help much. I made toast around noon but barely touched it. Eating felt like a chore. Lately, it’s like I don’t even get hungry anymore. Not really. I just feel numb. I stared at the plate for a while, trying to shake off the heavy feeling in my stomach, but then a car backfired outside. Loud. Sudden. My whole body locked up before I even realized what it was. My heart was racing, hands sweating. I sat there, gripping the table, trying to convince myself I was safe. At some point, I moved to the couch and turned on the TV, but I wasn’t really watching. My mind kept drifting back. I can still feel it—the weight of the moment, the helplessness. It doesn’t even make sense. It’s over. He’s gone. I’m fine. He won’t come back. Ever. That’s what everyone keeps telling me. But I’m not. I was supposed to meet Sarah today, but I canceled. Again. The thought of walking outside, even in broad daylight, made my chest tighten. I don’t want to explain it to her, don’t want to see that look on her face. I know she means nothing but well, but she doesn’t get it. No one does. Only I do. I told myself I’d go to bed early, but I know how that will go. I’ll lie there in the dark, every sound making my heart pound again and again. And then I’ll dream about it again. Like I do every night. Like I always will.

I don’t know why I feel this way. It’s just Thanksgiving. People do this every year—go home, eat turkey, chat about work, nod through political rants. It’s supposed to be normal. So why does my chest feel tight? Why did I wake up at 4 a.m., my mind racing through imaginary conversations with my mom? I should be excited to see everyone. Instead, I feel like I’m bracing for impact. It started days ago. I kept going over every detail in my head: Did I book the right train ticket? What if there’s a delay? What if I miss it and ruin the entire holiday? Then I worried about my mom. She always asks if I’m “seeing anyone.” What if I disappoint her again? What if I say the wrong thing and she spends the whole weekend looking at me like I’ve failed some invisible test? And then there’s my job. Someone’s bound to ask about work. I can already hear Aunt Linda’s voice, “Still at that same job? No promotion yet?” What am I supposed to say? That I’m exhausted? That I feel like I’m falling behind? That I’m so afraid of messing up I reread every email five times before sending it? No, of course not. I’ll smile and say, “Things are good,” and hope nobody presses. This morning, I had to sit down because my heart was pounding so fast. My hands felt shaky, and my stomach was twisted in knots. I told myself to breathe, but the more I tried, the worse it got. It doesn’t make sense. I know I’m not in danger. I know Thanksgiving isn’t life or death. But my body acts like it is. I finally made it to the train station, and it was packed. Too many people, too much noise. The announcements kept cutting out, and I panicked for a second that I was waiting at the wrong platform. I checked my ticket repeatedly, just to be sure. I could feel sweat on my palms even though it was cold outside. When I got on the train, I picked a window seat so I could stare outside and pretend I wasn’t trapped in a box full of strangers. Mom greeted me at the door, but I felt stiff. She noticed. “You okay?” she asked. “Just tired,” I said. I smiled so she wouldn’t worry. That’s my job, apparently. Dinner was fine. At least, I think it was. I barely tasted it. My brain was busy checking for signs that anyone was upset with me. Did I talk too much? Too little? Did I say something wrong? When I excused myself to go to the bathroom, I caught my reflection in the mirror. I looked normal. Not like someone whose thoughts were circling, whose muscles ached from being so tense. I should be happy, but I just feel exhausted.

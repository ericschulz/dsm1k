I woke up exhausted. I barely slept last night—again. The nightmares keep coming, like a reel that won’t stop. I was back there, reliving everything in vivid, agonizing detail. I woke up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I tried to tell myself it wasn’t real, but in those moments, it always feels real. I forced myself out of bed. The moment I stepped outside, the world seemed too loud, too bright, too dangerous. I flinched when a car honked nearby—my whole body tensed, and for a second, I wasn’t here anymore. I was there. My vision blurred, my hands trembled, and I had to remind myself to breathe. People passed by without noticing, but for me, it felt like time had stopped.I avoided taking the usual route to work. There’s a construction site on that street, and the loud noises—metal crashing, engines roaring—bring it all back. Even thinking about it makes my chest tighten. I took the long way around, but even then, I felt on edge. Every shadow, every sudden movement made my stomach twist. I kept scanning for exits, looking for threats. It’s exhausting to live like this, to always feel like danger is just around the corner. At work, I tried to focus, but the memories kept creeping in. A coworker dropped a stack of books, and the sudden noise sent a jolt of panic through me. I clenched my fists under the desk, trying to ground myself, trying not to let it show. But I could feel the stares. They think I’m just quiet, maybe a little withdrawn. They don’t know the truth. By lunchtime, I wasn’t hungry. I rarely am these days. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but now I make excuses. Being around people feels overwhelming. I don’t trust myself to keep it together, and I don’t want to explain why I suddenly zone out, why I flinch at small things, why I don’t laugh at their jokes anymore. So I sat alone, scrolling through my phone, pretending to be busy. The rest of the day passed in a haze. I kept spacing out, losing chunks of time, my mind pulling me back into memories I don’t want to see. I tried to push them away, but they’re always lurking beneath the surface. It’s like I’m living in two worlds—this one, where everything is supposed to be normal, and that one, where the worst moments of my life replay over and over. By the time I got home, I felt drained. I tried to watch TV, but my mind wouldn’t settle. Every scene reminded me of something. I turned it off. I should sleep, but I know what’s waiting for me when I do. Tomorrow will be the same. More exhaustion. More pretending. More memories. I just want to feel safe again.

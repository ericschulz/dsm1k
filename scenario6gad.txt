Dinner with Sarah should have been fun, but I spent the whole day dreading it. Not for any real reason—Sarah is my friend, I like her—but the worry just wouldn’t stop. What if she was only meeting me out of obligation? What if I said something awkward and made things weird? What if I embarrassed myself somehow? My stomach was in knots before I even left the house. I got to the restaurant ten minutes early. I always do, just in case. I checked my phone, wondering if she would cancel. No messages. I started overthinking—what if I had the wrong time? What if she forgot? What if she was mad at me and just didn’t want to come? I scrolled through our texts just to be sure. It was the right place. The right time. I still felt like something was wrong. Sarah arrived exactly on time, smiling as she sat down. “Hey! It’s so good to see you.” I smiled back, but my mind was already racing. Did she really mean that? Or was she just being polite? I tried to relax, but I could feel my shoulders tightening. We started talking, but I kept second-guessing everything I said. Was I talking too much? Too little? Was I being boring? My hands were clenched under the table. My heart was beating too fast, and for no reason. It wasn’t like anything bad was happening, but I couldn’t shake the unease. Then, the waiter came. I should’ve known what I wanted, but suddenly, I couldn’t decide. If I ordered something too expensive, would Sarah think I was being irresponsible? If I got something too cheap, would she think I was weird? The silence stretched too long. I felt my face heat up. “Uh—I’ll just have the pasta,” I blurted. Sarah didn’t seem to notice, but I was already berating myself. Why did I overthink everything? She was talking about work now, but I kept getting distracted. I worried I wasn’t reacting enough, or maybe too much. I laughed at something she said, then immediately panicked—was that an appropriate thing to laugh at? What if she thought I wasn’t taking her seriously? My mind wouldn’t stop spinning. Halfway through dinner, she asked, “Are you okay? You seem… tense.” I forced another smile. “Yeah, just tired.” It wasn’t a lie. I was always tired. Worrying all day, every day, is exhausting. We finished dinner, and I waited anxiously for the check. What if my card got declined? What if she thought I was being cheap? By the time I got home, I felt drained. I should have enjoyed dinner, but I barely remember it. All I do remember is the endless, pointless worry. And the worst part? Tomorrow, I’ll probably worry about this, too. Did I say something wrong? Did I seem weird? Will she ever want to see me again?

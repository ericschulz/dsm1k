I woke up late today, and the first thing I heard was that voice. It’s not Tom’s, not anyone I know. It says things like, “They’re watching,” and “Don’t trust the walls.” I couldn’t ignore it, but I tried. I got out of bed, but the room felt wrong. The walls looked too close, like they were closing in on me. The air felt thick, like it was suffocating me. I tried to ignore it, but everything felt distorted. I went into the kitchen, but the sounds were too loud. I didn’t want to eat, but I heard the voice telling me I had to. It wasn’t a normal voice. I tried to focus, but I couldn’t. The voice kept telling me what to do. It wasn’t my own thoughts. I moved to the living room, but the furniture wasn’t right. The couch was too far from the wall, the table crooked. I had to fix it, but it still didn’t feel right. The voice told me to fix it, but I couldn’t remember when it was right. Maybe it was never right. Then Tom came in and asked what I wanted to do today, but I couldn’t answer. The whispers were louder now, coming from the walls. They were talking about him. I couldn’t understand what they said, but I felt like I couldn’t trust him. I didn’t want him close. I told him I wasn’t feeling well, but I couldn’t explain why. I went outside, hoping it would help, but the street looked wrong. The houses were leaning toward me, the sky darker than it should’ve been. Everything felt warped, like it wasn’t real. People walked by, but they didn’t look real. They were blurry, like they were far away. The sounds didn’t make sense either, like they were coming from a different place. I couldn’t understand what was happening. I felt unsafe. I needed to go back inside, where I could control things. I locked the door behind me, but the voices followed me. They weren’t loud, but they never stopped. I called my mom, hoping to feel grounded, but she didn’t sound right. She was talking to someone I couldn’t hear. When I asked who it was, she said no one was there. I didn’t believe her. Something was wrong. I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s like the world is bending, twisting, and I can’t stop it. It’s like I’m stuck in a place where nothing feels real. I’m waiting for something to make sense again, but it never does. I can’t make it stop. I don’t know how to make it stop. It feels like it’s all around me. It’s always there. But no one else can see it. No one else hears it. Only me.

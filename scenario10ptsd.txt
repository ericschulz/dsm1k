Woke up to the sound of my own heartbeat thumping in my ears. I’ve been fighting the same battle for years, and I don’t know why I’m so tired. It’s not the kind of tired that goes away after a good night’s sleep. It’s in my bones. Every time I open my eyes, my body stiffens, waiting for something bad to happen. My stomach twists in knots. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not safe. I got out of bed too quickly. My legs were shaky, and my head spun, but I forced myself to keep going. Breakfast was fine—nothing special. But as I looked at the cereal box, it hit me again. The thoughts I’ve been trying to drown out all morning. How I can never feel like I have control. Every choice, even something as simple as what to eat, feels like it could spiral out of control. What if it leads to something terrible happening? I don’t trust myself to make the right decisions. Sometimes, it feels like I’m not even here. I feel detached, like I’m watching someone else go through the motions of living, but I’m not really living myself. Tom asked me about my day, and it felt like he was too close. Too normal. I’m sure he didn’t mean anything by it, but my mind spun. I snapped at him. Told him I didn’t want to talk. I went for a walk later, but the world felt too loud. Too busy. I couldn’t escape the thoughts racing through my head. I kept seeing flashes of places, faces, moments that I want to forget. It’s like I can’t get out of my own head. And I just know that someone is watching me. I can feel it. Even when no one’s around, it’s like they’re still there, ready to hurt me again. I’m always on alert. It’s exhausting. I feel like I might explode, like the world was closing in on me. I stayed home. Safe, at least for now. But even here, I can’t shake the tension. I feel like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. My heart races, my palms sweat, and I can’t breathe sometimes. At night, I felt the need to call my mom. I don’t know why. I needed reassurance. Her voice was calm, but it made me feel even more broken. I felt like I couldn’t tell her what I was really feeling, so I just pretended everything was okay. I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t. I just felt numb, trapped in this space between here and there. I don’t know how much longer I can do this. The nightmares keep coming, and I keep waking up. It is so scary. I just need it to stop. But I don’t know how.

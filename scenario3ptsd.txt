I spent most of the train ride gripping my armrest, keeping my eyes on the scenery rushing by. I kept reminding myself that I was safe. This was just Thanksgiving. But my body didn’t seem to care. My pulse was high, and my stomach twisted at the thought of stepping into my childhood home. I haven’t been back in over a year. Last time, Mom told me Dad had changed, that he had been going to church, that he was trying. But I can still hear his voice in my head, slurred with whiskey, sharp with anger. I tell myself I’m an adult now. I have a job, my own apartment. He can’t hurt me anymore. But the memories don’t listen to logic. They still make my hands shake. When I stepped off the train, my mom was there waiting. She smiled too quickly, like she was trying to convince herself everything was okay. I wondered if she noticed how stiff I was when she hugged me. On the car ride home, she asked about work, and I tried to answer, but my voice felt thin. My mind was already in the house. The walls, the kitchen, the sound of the back door slamming shut—I could feel it all, like I was already there. Walking through the door was worse than I expected. The air smelled the same—wood polish and faintly burnt. My brother called out a greeting from the couch, but I barely heard him. I was stuck in the threshold, heart pounding. For a second, I thought I heard footsteps behind me, too heavy, too familiar. My throat closed up. My mother’s voice pulled me back. “Come on in.” I nodded quickly and forced myself to move. Dinner was loud. People laughing, dishes clinking. But I couldn’t relax. Every time someone raised their voice, I flinched. Every time a chair scraped against the floor, I tensed. I kept watching my father’s hands, waiting for the telltale twitch, the curling of fingers into a fist. He was being nice. Too nice. And that terrified me more than anything. I barely ate. My stomach was too tight, too full of the past. At some point, I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I locked the door and pressed my hands against the sink, staring at my reflection. My face looked normal. But I felt like I was trapped in a place I had fought so hard to escape from. My breathing was shallow, my vision tunneled. I whispered to myself, “You’re safe. You’re safe.” But my body didn’t believe me. Back at the table, my mother squeezed my hand under the table. I forced a smile, but I knew she saw through it. I wondered if she regretted asking me to come. I wondered if I regretted coming at all. Thanksgiving is supposed to be about family. I wish mine didn’t feel like a battlefield.

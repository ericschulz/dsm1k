Dinner with Anna last night left me unsettled. I’ve seen patients struggle before, but it’s different when it’s someone you care about. I’ve known Anna for years, and despite everything, I still find myself hoping each time we meet that things will be better. They rarely are. I arrived at the restaurant on time, but she was already there, sitting alone with an empty wine glass in front of her. I recognized the tension in her posture immediately—the slight hunch, the way her fingers fidgeted with the stem of the glass. When she saw me, her face lit up so suddenly that it almost startled me. I knew that kind of intensity too well. Idealization. The moment where I could do no wrong. At first, things were pleasant. She was warm, affectionate even, speaking in fast, animated bursts. But soon, I felt the shift. I asked about her week, and something she darkened. She deflected at first, then whispered, “I feel like people don’t really care about me.” I reassured her, but I could see her doubt. No matter how many times I’ve tried, my words don’t seem to stick. As the evening went on, I noticed her drinking faster. When I hesitated over the menu, she laughed too loudly, as if she were trying to prove we were having fun. But the laughter faded quickly, and suddenly, she was accusing me of not being fully present. “You don’t actually want to be here, do you?” she asked. I’ve learned not to argue in these moments. I stayed calm, but inside, I braced myself. “Of course I do, Anna,” I said, keeping my voice soft. But she was already retreating. I could see it in the way her eyes narrowed, the way she leaned back in her chair. Then came the anger—sharp, fast, and disorienting. “You’re just like everyone else,” she snapped. “You’ll leave eventually.” I wanted to tell her that wasn’t true, that I cared. But I’ve seen this pattern too many times. Any reassurance I gave would only last until the next perceived slight. And then, just as quickly as it had appeared, the anger vanished. Her voice softened. “I’m sorry,” she murmured. “I didn’t mean that.” I nodded. This cycle—idealization, fear of abandonment, anger, and regret—was all too familiar. By the time the check arrived, she was holding my hand across the table, thanking me for always being there. And I did care. But I also knew that tomorrow, or next week, I could just as easily be the enemy again. I walked home thinking about how much she must be suffering. How exhausting it must be to live in a world where every interaction feels like life or death. And how, no matter how much I understand her illness, I can never quite fix it. Some things, I remind myself, are beyond even a psychiatrist’s reach.

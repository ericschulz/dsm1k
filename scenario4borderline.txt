I told myself I wouldn’t come back. Not after last time. But the apartment walls felt like they were closing in, and I couldn’t breathe, so here I am—again. The library seemed like a safe place, or at least, it did this morning. I got here early, before most people, and for a little while, it was peaceful. Just the soft rustle of pages, the quiet hum of the air conditioning. I tried to focus on my book—something about art history—but the words blurred. My thoughts kept pulling me in different directions. I should be studying, but what’s the point? Everything feels so meaningless sometimes. Then, I saw her. That girl from the other week. She smiled at me, and I thought maybe we could be friends. I thought we had a connection. But today, she barely looked at me. I waved, just a small movement, but she didn’t see—or maybe she did and ignored me. My stomach twisted. I felt stupid, exposed. Was I imagining things last time? Did she decide she doesn’t like me anymore? I wanted to leave right then, but I couldn’t. Instead, I sat there, gripping my book, pretending to read. The feeling built up—like a storm tightening in my chest. I hate this. I hate feeling so out of control. I could feel the anger creeping in, the sharp edge of it. She thinks she’s better than me. No—she just doesn’t care. No one does. I had to do something, so I left my things at the table and went to the bathroom. Stared at myself in the mirror. I looked wrong. My face felt unfamiliar, like it wasn’t really mine. My hands trembled, and I thought I might disappear. I gripped the sink until I could breathe again. When I came back, my book was gone. Someone had moved my things, probably because I was gone too long. But in that moment, it felt personal, like proof that I didn’t belong here, that I was an inconvenience. I wanted to scream. Instead, I just stared at the table, empty now, like I wasn’t even here. I don’t remember leaving. Just walking outside, feeling cold even though the sun was bright. I thought about texting Sam, but I didn’t. He’s probably sick of me. Everyone gets sick of me eventually. Now I’m back home, sitting in bed, and everything feels distant, like today didn’t even happen. I keep thinking about that girl—about how, for a moment, I thought we were the same, and how stupid that was. I can’t trust my own feelings. One minute, someone’s everything, and the next, they’re nothing. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Or maybe I do. Maybe it’s always been this way. I just wish I could stop feeling so much. Or at least, feel something that stays.

I woke up at 8:30, though I had been drifting in and out of sleep for a while. The air felt strange this morning, thicker somehow, like the room was pressing in on me. I stayed in bed for a bit, staring at the ceiling, trying to decipher the pattern in the cracks. They looked different today, almost like they were forming letters. I blinked, and the shapes disappeared. Maybe I was still half-asleep. Eventually, I got up and made coffee. The toaster made a clicking sound that seemed… off, like a little too sharp, too deliberate. Machines have their own way of communicating. I wonder if other people notice that. I try not to mention these things anymore. The last time I told Sarah that streetlights flicker when I walk under them, she just gave me a look. But it happens. Not every time, but often enough that it can’t be coincidence. I sat at my desk and tried to work, but my thoughts were pulling me in too many directions. I kept feeling like I was on the verge of understanding something important, like there was a hidden layer beneath everything if I could just piece it together. My emails sat open, unread. People expect me to respond to these, but I don’t know what to say. They phrase things so strangely, like they’re testing me, waiting for me to slip up. It’s hard to tell what’s real communication and what’s not. Around noon, I realized I was hungry, but eating felt unnecessary, like a chore rather than a need. I made toast, but the sound of the knife against the plate was too sharp, like it cut through more than just bread. I stared at it for a while, feeling like I was outside of myself, watching from a distance. The moment stretched, and then the phone vibrated, snapping me back. Sarah had finally replied to my message. “Hey, sorry, just busy.” But what does that mean? The words felt hollow, like placeholders for something else. I read it a few times, trying to sense the real meaning. Was she avoiding me? Or was she warning me? The message had a rhythm to it. I should look into that, see if there’s a pattern in the way people text. I wanted to ask her about it, but I stopped myself. People don’t like when I ask too many questions. I’ve learned that. They get uncomfortable when I bring up things they don’t notice. I closed my phone and sat in silence for a while, listening. Sometimes, if I listen hard enough, I can hear something beneath the usual noise, like a frequency just out of reach. Today, it was faint, but it was there. I should try to finish my work. People expect me to keep up appearances. But I can feel the spaces between things shifting, just slightly. Maybe tomorrow, it will make sense.

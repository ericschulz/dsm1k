I wasn’t sure if it was the right decision, but I told myself I needed to go. The movie theater, a place like any other, but as I walked toward it, I felt the familiar pull. I had checked my pockets twice to make sure I had everything: phone, wallet, keys, ticket. I couldn’t stop double-checking. What if I forgot something? What if I dropped my wallet in the theater and couldn’t find it? I had to make sure everything was in its proper place. I stood in line to buy the ticket, and even though I knew I was holding the correct amount of cash, I counted it again. I couldn’t help myself. The thoughts kept creeping in: What if I counted wrong? What if I didn’t have enough? I’d be embarrassed. I checked the time on my phone, and then I checked it again. What if I wasn’t on time? The movie would start without me, and I’d miss something important. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something would go wrong if I didn’t follow the right steps. When I entered the theater, I scanned the room for the perfect seat. I couldn’t sit anywhere—no, the seat had to be aligned just right. It couldn’t be too close to the screen, or too far away. If I sat too far to the left or right, something would go wrong. I couldn’t risk it. I also had to make sure I wasn’t sitting too close to anyone. I couldn’t be near anyone who might touch me or disrupt my space. I adjusted my seat multiple times, making sure everything was in its exact spot. As the lights dimmed and the movie started, I focused on the screen, but the thoughts wouldn’t stop. What if the movie wasn’t what I expected? What if I missed something crucial because I didn’t pay attention? I couldn’t let that happen. I needed to focus. The sounds in the theater felt louder than they should have been, distracting me from the plot. What if the sound was too loud for my ears? What if the person sitting next to me made a noise and ruined everything? I had to stay focused. I counted my breaths to make sure I was breathing the right way. But what if something terrible happened? What if I had a panic attack? I kept adjusting my position, trying to find the right balance between comfort and control. Every little thing felt like it needed to be just right. Even when the movie finished, I felt the overwhelming urge to check the seat and make sure nothing had been left behind. I counted the steps as I walked out, making sure each step was perfectly aligned. It didn’t stop when I left the theater. The need to double-check everything lingered with me long after I was home.

I woke up a little later than usual today. The sunlight was already coming through the window, and I heard the usual sounds of the morning—birds chirping, the distant hum of traffic. It was a peaceful start to the day. I stretched and got out of bed, feeling ready to face whatever was ahead. I had a few things to do today, but nothing too stressful. I grabbed my phone to check the time, and then I went into the bathroom to get ready. As I looked in the mirror, everything felt normal—no odd feelings or distortions, just a regular morning routine. I brushed my teeth and washed my face, enjoying the cool water on my skin. I wasn’t in a rush, so I took my time. The day felt calm, and I looked forward to having some time to relax later. After getting dressed, I made my way to the kitchen to make some breakfast. I decided on a quick smoothie, since I wasn’t too hungry. I made sure to gather all the ingredients and blended everything together. The sound of the blender was loud, but it didn’t bother me. It was just part of the process. As I ate, I thought about my plans for the day. I had a few tasks to tackle at work, but nothing that seemed difficult. I felt focused and in control. The kitchen looked just as it always did—nothing out of place. Everything felt familiar, comfortable. I finished breakfast, cleaned up, and then decided to take a walk outside to get some fresh air before heading to work. The weather was nice, just a little chilly, and the streets were calm. I passed a few people on my walk. The houses were where they should be, the trees swayed gently in the breeze. It was a typical morning. I wasn’t worried about anything. On the way to work, I thought about how nice it was to have a quiet day ahead. I wasn’t distracted by any strange thoughts, and I didn’t feel overwhelmed by anything. When I got to the office, I settled into my workspace and checked my emails. There was nothing out of the ordinary. I felt clear-headed and productive. I got through my to-do list, checking off each item without any stress. My colleagues were in a good mood, and we chatted for a while during lunch. Everything was perfectly normal, and I felt comfortable and at ease. In the afternoon, I made a phone call to my mom, just to check in. She was doing well, and we had a nice conversation about what’s been going on lately. There was nothing strange or out of place. After work, I went home, where I relaxed with a book for a while before making dinner. It was a simple meal, but I enjoyed it. I went to bed feeling content, ready to sleep and start the next day.

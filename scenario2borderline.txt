Today was supposed to be perfect. We had planned this trip for weeks, and I woke up excited, like this would finally be the kind of day where everything just felt right. But now, sitting here at the end of it, I don’t know what to think. It was fun, wasn’t it? There were moments when I laughed, when I felt completely there, completely alive. And yet, now that it’s over, I can’t shake this awful, hollow feeling. The day started fine. When we got to the park, I felt this rush, like everything was brighter and louder in a good way. I wanted to do everything—every ride, every game, every little thing I could fit into the day. I felt so connected to the people I was with, like we were all part of something special. But then, out of nowhere, things started shifting. It was something small at first—someone didn’t answer me right away when I spoke, or maybe I imagined a change in their tone. Suddenly, it was like I was watching everything from a distance. I felt this sharp irritation, like I didn’t belong, like maybe they didn’t even want me there. I told myself I was overreacting, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. It got worse when we stood in line for a ride. The wait felt endless, and the longer we stood there, the more I felt like something was wrong. I didn’t know what, exactly, just that everything felt off. I tried to ignore it, but soon, I was overwhelmed. The noise, the heat, the people pressed too close—it was all too much. I wanted to leave, to disappear, but at the same time, I couldn’t stand the thought of being alone. It felt like I was trapped between two terrible choices. I could feel my emotions shifting so fast I could barely keep up. One moment I wanted to cry, the next I was furious for no reason at all. By the time we got to the Ferris wheel, I felt empty. Like I had burned through everything and now there was just nothing left. I sat there, watching the lights of the park, and I felt this aching loneliness. Even surrounded by people, even with laughter all around me, I felt completely disconnected. I started wondering if anyone really cared about me, if I even mattered. Maybe they were only putting up with me. Maybe I was too much. Now that I’m home, I feel ridiculous for thinking that. They love me, I think. I know they do. But why does it never feel enough? Why do I go from feeling on top of the world to barely holding it together? I wish I could be normal. I wish I didn’t always feel like I’m either too much or not enough. What’s wrong with me? All I wanted was to have a good day.

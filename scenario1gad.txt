I woke up feeling tense. It happens most mornings—before I even open my eyes, my chest feels tight, and my mind is already racing through the day ahead. I try to tell myself that nothing is actually wrong, but it never seems to work. There’s always this underlying feeling, this nagging worry that something will go wrong. I just don’t know what or when. I lay in bed for a while, thinking about work. Did I forget something important? What if I make a mistake? What if my boss notices and thinks I’m incompetent? What if I lose my job? I tell myself it’s an overreaction, but my brain keeps running through worst-case scenarios, each one more catastrophic than the last. Eventually, I drag myself out of bed, but the exhaustion is already there. On the way to work, I avoided the usual route—not because of anything specific, but because traffic makes me nervous. I don’t like feeling trapped between cars, stuck in a place where I can’t easily get out. What if I get stuck in traffic for hours? What if I have a panic attack and there’s no way to escape? I know it’s unlikely, but the thoughts don’t stop. So, I take the long way, even though I know it’s irrational. At the office, I try to focus, but my mind keeps jumping from one worry to the next. Did I word that email correctly? What if my coworker misinterprets it? What if I said something wrong in yesterday’s meeting? I feel like I’m constantly on edge, like there’s this invisible pressure pushing down on me. Then, in the afternoon, someone drops a heavy stack of books, and the loud noise makes me flinch. My heart starts racing, and for a second, I feel like I might actually be in danger. But it’s just a normal sound, something that shouldn’t bother me. I laugh it off, pretending it didn’t affect me, but I can feel my hands shaking under my desk. By the time I get home, I’m exhausted. Not from anything real, but from the constant battle in my head. Even as I try to relax, my mind won’t. I think about tomorrow, about everything that could go wrong. I think about things I said years ago and wonder if people still judge me. I think about my health—what if this tightness in my chest is something serious? What if I have a heart condition and don’t even know it? I know I worry too much. People have told me that my whole life. “Just stop overthinking,” they say, like it’s that easy. I wish I could turn my brain off for just a few hours, but no matter what I do, the thoughts keep coming. There’s no off switch—just a constant stream of what-ifs, circling in my mind.

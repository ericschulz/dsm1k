I went to the library today. Nothing particularly special happened, but sometimes I like days like this. I spent most of the day at the library, which was exactly what I needed. The morning was cool, and the walk over was refreshing. It’s funny how much I love libraries. Something about the atmosphere—the way everyone is there with a purpose, quietly working—makes it easier to focus. I grabbed a seat by the window, set my coffee down, and spread out my notes. Lately, I’ve been really interested in personality disorders, so I spent the morning reading about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). It’s fascinating but also kind of heartbreaking. The emotional intensity, the unstable sense of self, the fear of abandonment—it must be exhausting to live like that. I read about how people with BPD sometimes misinterpret social cues, jumping to conclusions about what others think of them. That must make daily life so difficult. Around midday, I took a break and walked around. That’s when I noticed a girl sitting a few tables away. She seemed lost in thought, staring down at her book without really turning the pages. At one point, she glanced up and waved at someone, but they didn’t respond. I wondered if they didn’t see her or if they were just preoccupied. She looked uncomfortable for a moment, shifting in her seat, before getting up and heading toward the bathrooms. I went back to my book, but I couldn’t help but think about how social interactions can be so tricky. A simple misunderstanding—like someone not noticing a wave—might not mean much to me, but to someone struggling with BPD, it could feel devastating. I read about how these moments can trigger a spiral of emotions, how people with BPD sometimes experience anger or sadness far more intensely than others. It made me think about how important it is to be aware of what others might be going through. After lunch, I got back to work, making notes and summarizing key points. The case studies were particularly interesting. One described a woman who felt like she didn’t have a stable identity, constantly changing her interests and opinions depending on who she was with. Another talked about impulsive behaviors—things like reckless spending or self-harm. The more I read, the more I realized how complex this disorder is. It’s not just mood swings or being “overly emotional.” It’s a deep, painful struggle with self-worth and connection. By the time I packed up my things, the sun had started to set. I left feeling grateful—for my studies, for my ability to understand more about the human mind, and honestly, for the simple ease of my own emotions. Some people wake up every day feeling like they don’t know who they are, like the world is too much. I can’t imagine that. But I can learn and understand it better.

Dinner with Sarah was really nice. It had been a while since we last caught up, and I forgot how much I enjoy spending time with her. Life gets so busy with work and everything else, and I always tell myself I’ll make more time for friends, but somehow weeks just slip by and I never manage. I’m glad we finally made plans. I got to the restaurant a little early, so I grabbed a table by the window. It gave me a chance to people-watch while I waited. The place was pretty full, and the hum of conversation felt warm and lively. A waiter passed by carrying a tray of pasta dishes, and the smell of garlic and fresh herbs made my stomach growl. Sarah arrived right on time, smiling as she walked in. She looked great, as always—effortlessly put together in that way she does without even trying. “I’ve been looking forward to this all day,” she said as she hugged me, and I realized I actually had, too. We settled in quickly, slipping into the kind of easy conversation that happens when you’ve known someone for many years. She told me about her job, some new project she was excited about, and I updated her on my latest work drama. We laughed over how ridiculous office politics can be and agreed to talk about something else. Sarah wanted to go travelling soon. The waiter came to take our order, and I hesitated for a second—everything looked good. “What are you getting?” I asked Sarah, hoping to narrow it down. She went for the salmon, but I ended up choosing a pasta dish that sounded amazing. I figured I’d just steal a bite of hers, like always. As we ate, we talked about everything and nothing. Travel plans, funny stories from the past, random thoughts about life. It felt good to just sit and be present. At one point, a tray crashed to the floor behind us, making us jump. The whole restaurant went silent for a second before people started clapping. We laughed and shook our heads—it’s always awkward when that happens. After dinner, we lingered a bit, letting the conversation wind down naturally. Neither of us was in a rush to leave, which was nice. Eventually, we paid the bill and stepped outside. The air was crisp but not too cold, the perfect kind of night for a walk. “Let’s not wait so long to do this again,” Sarah said, and I wholeheartedly agreed. As I walked home, I felt lighter. It’s funny how just a couple of hours with a good friend can make such a difference. I need to remember this—to make more time for moments like these. Perhaps I should simply meet with Sarah more often as well; it is always a pleasure to hang out with her. Life moves fast, but these small, simple joys are what really matter.

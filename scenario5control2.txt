I arrived in Berlin this morning, excited for a short getaway. The train ride was smooth, and I managed to doze off for a while. Traveling by train has always been something I enjoy—the steady rhythm, the soft murmur of conversations in the background, and the scenery rushing by. There’s something calming about it. I had my coffee and a croissant at the station before boarding, and for once, I didn’t check my phone obsessively. No work emails, no last-minute messages—just time to myself. I let my mind wander, thinking about what I wanted to do in the city. Maybe I’d visit a museum, walk along the Spree, or find a nice café to sit and watch the world go by. When we pulled into the Berlin Hauptbahnhof, I felt that familiar sense of excitement I always get in a new city. There’s something about arriving somewhere different that makes everything feel fresh, even if I’ve been here before. The station was busy, but not in an overwhelming way—just the usual mix of tourists looking at maps and commuters moving with purpose. I stepped outside and took a deep breath. The air was warm, and the sky was clear. The city felt alive, buzzing with movement. I had some time before check-in, so I decided to find a café. I love the feeling of sitting down with a coffee in a new place, taking in the atmosphere, and watching people go about their day. As I walked through the streets, I admired the mix of modern and historic architecture, the way Berlin blends the past and present so effortlessly. There were cyclists weaving through traffic, street musicians playing in the distance, and small shops lining the streets. I took my time, enjoying the moment. I found a café with a cozy outdoor seating area and ordered an espresso. The server was friendly, and the place had a relaxed vibe. I took a seat by the window and watched as people passed by—some in a rush, others strolling leisurely, lost in conversation. As I took my first sip, a chair scraped against the floor behind me. It was a sharp sound, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, thinking about what I wanted to do next. Maybe I’d visit Museum Island or walk along the East Side Gallery. I didn’t have a strict plan, and that was the best part. No stress, no obligations—just time to explore at my own pace. I pulled out my book and let myself settle into the moment. The espresso was strong and rich, just the way I liked it. The city felt welcoming, full of possibilities. Sometimes, the best part of traveling isn’t the big sights or famous landmarks—it’s these quiet moments, sitting in a café, feeling like you belong, even if just for a little while. I smiled to myself. This was exactly what I needed.

I woke up exhausted again. I must have woken up six times during the night, and each time, my mind was already running before I was even fully conscious. Stupid things, really. Did I forget to pay the internet bill? What if I accidentally offended Sarah yesterday? What if there’s something wrong with my stomach? The thoughts pile up so fast, it’s like I never actually sleep. I forced myself out of bed around 8:30. I told myself I’d get started on work right away, but I just sat at my desk, staring at my laptop. My hands felt tense, like I’d been gripping something all night. I should have replied to my emails, but I kept rereading the drafts, second-guessing every word. I finally hit send after checking one of them six times. By noon, I still hadn’t eaten, because my stomach felt tight. When I finally made toast, I kept thinking, What if I choke while eating alone? The thought was ridiculous, but it wouldn’t leave me alone. I took small bites just in case. The afternoon felt like a blur. I kept trying to work, but my mind wouldn’t stay on one thing for long. Every few minutes, I’d get up, pace the room, then sit back down. I must have checked my phone fifty times. I kept expecting some bad news—an email from work saying I’d made a mistake, a message from a friend saying they were upset with me. I know it doesn’t make sense, but the uncertainty is unbearable. By 3:00, I realized I hadn’t left the apartment all day. I thought about going for a walk, but then I worried—what if I ran into a neighbor and had to make small talk? What if I had a panic attack in the middle of the street? My heart started pounding just thinking about it, so I stayed inside. Around 6:00, I tried to relax. I put on a movie, but I kept pausing it, rewinding, realizing I hadn’t been paying attention. My mind kept going back to this morning’s emails. Did I sound stupid? Did I forget something? I even considered emailing again. By 8:00, my muscles ached from the day. I told myself I should stretch or do some yoga, but even that felt overwhelming. What if I did it wrong and hurt myself? Instead, I scrolled through my phone, reading news stories that only made me more anxious. The world feels so uncertain, and I feel like I should be doing something, but I don’t even know what. Now it’s nearly midnight. I should be asleep, but I know I won’t be. I’ll lie in bed, my heart pounding, my mind convincing me I’ve forgotten something important, that something bad is about to happen. I don’t know why I always feel this way. I just do.

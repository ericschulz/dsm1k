I arrived in Berlin this morning, but I feel like I’ve made a mistake coming here. The train ride should have been simple—I booked my ticket a week ago, checked the route three times, and even set an alarm an hour early just in case. But the entire journey, I couldn’t stop thinking: What if I got off at the wrong station? What if I lost my suitcase? My heart wouldn’t settle, and I must have checked my bag’s zipper a hundred times. Now that I’m here, the city feels too large, too chaotic. Everyone moves so quickly, and I keep thinking I’ll get lost or—worse—someone will steal my wallet. I keep my hand on my pocket, clutching it like a lifeline. I remind myself that I’ve never lost my wallet before, but the thought won’t let go. I’m supposed to be enjoying this trip. I planned everything, down to the cafés I’d visit. But my mind refuses to stay in the moment. As I sat in a coffee shop this afternoon, I stared at my cappuccino, barely tasting it, too caught up in the thought that I might be late checking into my hotel. I knew I had plenty of time—I had set two alarms on my phone to remind me—but what if something unexpected happened? What if I got locked out? What if they lost my reservation? I left in a hurry, my stomach tight, my breath shallow. Checking in went fine. Of course, it did. But I spent the next hour pacing my tiny hotel room, feeling my muscles clench as if I had just run a marathon. My head ached. My shoulders felt like stone. I knew I should lie down, but my thoughts kept racing: What if I get sick here? What if something happens to Mom while I’m gone? She told me she was fine when I called, but she sounded tired—was she just pretending? I should call her again, but I don’t want to be annoying. Maybe I’ll text her instead. I tried to distract myself by watching TV, but I couldn’t focus. I kept picking up my phone, checking my emails, rereading messages I’d already seen. It’s exhausting to feel this on edge all the time. I should be out exploring, but even the idea of stepping outside makes my chest feel tight. Tomorrow, I have a museum visit planned, but I already feel like canceling. What if I can’t find it? What if I look stupid asking for directions? What if I feel this awful the whole time? I told myself this trip would be fun, that it would be a break from my usual routine, but I feel more drained than ever. Maybe I should just go home early. I don’t know. I’ll think about it tomorrow. But then again, what if tomorrow is worse?

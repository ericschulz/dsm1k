I woke up feeling exhausted. The dream was hazy but it lingered. I kept thinking about it—being locked in a room with no doors, no escape. It felt like a symbol of something, but I wasn’t sure what. My mind couldn’t latch onto any one thought long enough to make sense of it. My head was foggy, and I could barely make myself focus on getting out of bed. The idea of facing the day felt overwhelming. But I had to go to church. I knew I would have to go because it’s something I’ve always done, and I couldn’t stand the thought of people asking questions if I didn’t show up. The thought of interacting with anyone made my stomach twist, but it wasn’t like I could just avoid it. I forced myself to get dressed, but it felt like each step I took was a monumental effort. When I arrived at the church, it felt like the world was spinning. I looked around, but everything seemed blurry. People were talking and laughing, and it felt like they were all moving too fast. My head throbbed with the noise, the chatter, and the movement. I wanted to sit down, but the idea of sitting there, trying listen to the sermon, seemed impossible. I found a seat in the back, my hands clenched tightly in my lap, trying to steady myself. As the service started, I found it hard to pay attention. My mind kept drifting—one thought leading to another until I was lost in an endless loop. The pastor’s voice was distant, like I was hearing him through water. I couldn’t concentrate on what he was saying. It felt like the words were meaningless, just noise in the background. I started to zone out, and I felt like I was outside of myself, watching but not really participating. Someone laughed behind me, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were laughing at me. I kept replaying their laugh in my head, unable to stop myself. Was it my appearance? My awkwardness? It didn’t make sense, but it felt so real. My hands were shaking, and I couldn’t focus on the sermon anymore. The idea of turning around to check if they were still laughing was unbearable. I stood up abruptly, my legs stiff, and walked out. The hallway felt like it stretched on forever, but I didn’t care. I needed space. I couldn’t breathe anymore. The thoughts in my head were too much. I pressed my hands to my face. I felt detached, like I was just moving through the motions. When I stepped outside, the sunlight hit me like a shock. But I needed something to ground me, to stop the feeling of floating. But I still felt disconnected, unable to focus or calm down. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. What was I supposed to feel?

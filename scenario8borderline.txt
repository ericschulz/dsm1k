I woke up feeling like I had been abandoned in a storm. Maybe it was the dream I had—something about being left alone in a room with no doors. Or maybe it was nothing at all. Mornings are unpredictable. Sometimes, I wake up ready to take on the world. Other times, like today, I feel hollow. Like I'm already falling before the day has even begun.

Still, I knew I had to go to church. If I skipped, people would notice. Or maybe they wouldn’t. Maybe I don’t even matter enough for them to care. But no, I couldn’t let myself think like that. I just needed to get through the morning. The moment I walked in, something shifted. The air felt heavy, pressing down on me. I scanned the room for familiar faces, for proof that I wasn’t alone. I found them—smiling, talking, completely wrapped up in their own worlds. I waved at someone I knew, and they barely acknowledged me. A second later, I convinced myself they hated me. My stomach twisted. Why am I so easy to forget? I should leave. But no—then they’d think I’m dramatic. I sat in the pew, gripping my hands together, trying to steady myself. The sermon started, but I couldn’t focus. My thoughts pulled me in different directions, unraveling faster than I could hold them together. Someone laughed behind me. Were they laughing at me? I turned, but they weren’t even looking my way. Still, the feeling stuck, clinging to my skin like damp cloth. And then came the moment. The voice of the pastor shifted, deep and stern, and it hit something inside me—like an echo of every time I’ve been judged, abandoned, or hurt. Suddenly, I hated him. Hated his words, his tone, this place. Why did I even come? What was I trying to prove? My chest burned with something hot and raw, and before I knew it, I was standing. I didn’t think. I just walked out. The doors swung closed behind me, and I stood in the hallway, shaking. I should go back. No, I can’t. If I go back, they’ll see me like this. But if I leave, they’ll say I’m unstable. Either way, I lose. I pressed my back against the wall, gripping my arms. My skin felt too tight. Too much, too much, too much. The sermon was ending. People would come out soon. Would they ask if I was okay? Or would they just walk past me? I didn’t know which thought was worse. I swallowed hard and forced myself to breathe. When I finally stepped outside, the sunlight hit me, bright and blinding. For a moment, I felt weightless, untethered. But then the familiar fear crept back in. What if I made a mistake? What if I ruined everything? What if I wake up and feel nothing? I don’t know.

I thought today would be a good distraction. We’ve been planning the trip to the theme park for a while, but it didn’t go the way I imagined. From the moment we entered the park, I felt a weight in my chest that wouldn’t let up. It wasn’t the crowds or the noise, though they didn’t help. It was the feeling that something could go wrong at any moment, like I was on edge the entire time, waiting for something I couldn’t quite name to happen. The moment I stepped in, the chaos hit me. Kids yelling, people laughing, music blaring. It felt like too much, like I couldn’t breathe. I kept telling myself it was fine, it was just a theme park. But every person that brushed by me, every loud sound, made my heart race. I kept scanning the crowd, watching for threats—just like I did back then, when I was overseas. Back then, everything felt uncertain, like at any moment the whole world could change in an instant. Now, here in the park, it wasn’t like that, but it didn’t matter. The feeling was the same. We started walking toward the first ride, and I noticed my hands were trembling. I tried to focus on the kids, on keeping everything normal, but my mind kept wandering. I kept thinking about what could go wrong—what if someone gets too close, what if the ride breaks down, what if I lose track of them?  As we waited in line for the Ferris wheel, the crowd seemed to close in. The space felt smaller, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to happen. I felt exposed, like I couldn’t control my surroundings. The noise of people laughing, shouting, the thudding bass from the music—it was too much. I kept trying to focus on the ride ahead, but all I could think about was how long it would take, how high we’d go, and whether I could handle it without losing my composure. When we finally got on, I couldn’t stop staring at the safety bar. My mind kept flashing back to a time when I had to keep an eye on everything around me. It was just the park, and yet it felt the same. I kept pushing myself to stay present, to be normal. But I found myself breathing shallowly, just trying to get through it. I couldn’t let go. I was always waiting for the next jarring noise, the next moment that would make me freeze again. I just wanted it to end, but we stayed until the park started closing. I was so drained by the end of the day, not from the physical exertion, but from trying to keep myself together. I don’t think I’ll do this again. The stress was too much. It’s harder than I thought to escape my own mind.

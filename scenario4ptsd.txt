I thought today would be fine. Just another day at the library, getting work done, keeping my head down. But I should have known better. I should have known by now that places can turn on you, that nothing is ever truly safe. It started out okay. I got here early, when it was still calm. I found a seat by the window, far enough from the entrance so I wouldn’t have to keep looking over my shoulder. I took out my notes and tried to focus. My hands felt a little shaky, but I ignored it. I’m used to that by now. For a while, I managed to get some reading done. I even lost myself in it—just for a little bit. But then, out of nowhere, someone dropped a heavy book onto a table. The sound cracked through the silence like a gunshot. My body reacted before my brain did. My heart slammed against my ribs, my breath caught, and suddenly, I was back there. It wasn’t a book hitting a table—it was the explosion. The screams. The sirens. I gripped the edge of the desk, trying to pull myself back. It’s not real. You’re here, in the library. You’re safe. But my body didn’t believe me. The rush of adrenaline, the dizziness, the tightness in my chest—it all felt too real. I needed to get out, but I couldn’t move. My legs were locked, frozen. People were looking at me. Were they? I didn’t know. I couldn’t tell. I finally managed to get up. I walked fast, not running, but close. I locked myself in a bathroom stall, pressing my back against the door. My hands were shaking too much to check the time. I focused on breathing. In for four, hold for four, out for four. It barely helped. My shirt was damp with sweat. After a while, the feeling passed, or at least, dulled enough. I splashed cold water on my face, stared at my reflection. I looked normal. No one would know. I told myself I’d go back to my seat, but instead, I found a corner in the farthest row of bookshelves and sat on the floor. I pulled my knees up to my chest, forcing my body into something small, something contained. The exhaustion set in, the heaviness in my limbs that always follows these episodes. I should go home, but I don’t want to. Home isn’t better. Home is just more hours alone with my thoughts. Eventually, I stood up and wandered through the shelves, not really looking at anything. I caught a glimpse of a girl at a nearby table, staring blankly at her book, lost in her own head. For a moment, I wondered if she felt the same way I did. If she, too, was somewhere else entirely. I did not get any work done. But I made it through the day.

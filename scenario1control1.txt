I woke up groggy again. I don’t know if it’s the dreams or just my brain refusing to rest, but sleep hasn’t felt refreshing in a long time. I dream about it sometimes—not every night, but enough that it lingers. The images aren’t always clear, but the feeling is. The fear. The helplessness. And then I wake up, and for a moment, it’s like I’m still there. My heart is racing, my body tense, like it’s bracing for something. But then I open my eyes, and I’m just in my bedroom. I dragged myself out of bed and tried to shake it off. I tell myself it’s in the past. Most days, I believe that. But some days—like today—it follows me around like a shadow. I try not to dwell on it, but little things bring it back. The way the morning light hits my window a certain way, a faint smell of something I can’t quite place. It’s like my body remembers things my mind isn’t even consciously thinking about. On the way to work, I took a different route. Not because I had to, but because I prefer to avoid certain places. I know it’s irrational, but something about that street makes my skin crawl. It reminds me too much of before. I tell myself it’s just a precaution, that anyone would avoid something that makes them uncomfortable. But maybe I’m just fooling myself. At work, I felt a little on edge, but nothing overwhelming. Then, during a meeting, someone slammed a door too hard, and I jumped. It was embarrassing. My heart raced before I could calm down. People probably noticed, but no one said anything. I laughed it off, acted like it was nothing. It was nothing. Right? Still, it left me feeling uneasy for the rest of the day. I kept getting distracted, my thoughts drifting when I should have been focusing. It’s not like I’m constantly reliving the past or anything, but sometimes, it sneaks up on me in ways I don’t expect. I don’t avoid thinking about it, but I don’t exactly want to either. Some things are just better left alone. I made plans with some friends after work, but when the time came, I wasn’t in the mood. I told them I was too tired, which wasn’t a lie. I am tired. But that wasn’t the whole reason. I don’t know—it just felt easier to go home, to be alone. It’s not that I don’t like being around people, but sometimes it feels like too much. Now that I’m home, I feel fine. A little drained, but fine. I’ll probably read for a bit, maybe watch something until I feel sleepy enough to get some rest. Maybe tonight will be better. Most days, I’m okay. Just not always.

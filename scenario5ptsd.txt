I should have taken the bus or come here by car. I knew it the moment I stepped onto the train platform this morning, but I told myself it was just a normal two-hour ride. People take trains every day. Statistically, they’re totally safe. I repeated that in my head like a prayer, but my body didn’t believe it. As soon as I boarded, the tightness in my chest started. The seats, the hum of the engine, the way the light flickered when we passed under a tunnel—it was all too familiar. My fingers dug into my thigh. I counted my breaths like the therapist told me: in for four, hold for four, out for four. It didn’t help. Every jolt of the train sent a fresh spike of panic through me. I kept imagining the worst. The wheels screeching, metal twisting, people screaming—just like before. At one point, I smelled something—burning rubber, or maybe just hot brakes—but it sent me spiraling. My hands went clammy. My body locked up. I had to fight the urge to run. But where? We were moving too fast. No escape. My stomach turned, and I barely swallowed down the nausea. By the time we arrived, I was drained. I stumbled off the train, legs weak, my brain still stuck somewhere else. Berlin stretched out before me, busy and loud, but I felt detached, like I was watching it all through glass. I made my way to a café, hoping that caffeine might clear my head. The moment I sat down, a chair scraped against the floor behind me—sharp, sudden. My heart slammed against my ribs. For a split second, I was back there. The crash, the impact, the noise. I whipped around, expecting wreckage, chaos. But it was just a man adjusting his seat. My face burned. I felt stupid. But my hands were still shaking. I texted Sam, needing an anchor. “Made it to Berlin. Train was okay.” A lie. He replied quickly—too quickly: “Proud of you.” I hated that. Hated how it made me feel fragile. Like a child who needed a gold star for making it through the day. But wasn’t that the truth? Just getting here felt like a battle. The rest of the afternoon blurred. I kept flinching at small sounds—a honking car, a dropped plate, a laugh that was just a little too loud. My body braced for something that wasn’t coming. At the hotel, I checked the emergency exits twice before finally putting my bag down. I ran the shower, letting the sound fill the room, grounding me. But when I closed my eyes, I saw flashes again. The wreck. The blood. The suffering. I snapped my eyes open and stared at the water swirling down the drain. It was over. It had been over for years. And yet, here I was. Still there. Still running. Maybe I should have taken the bus.

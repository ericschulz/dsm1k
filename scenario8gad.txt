I woke up today feeling like the world was collapsing in on me. The heaviness settled into my chest. I was already bracing for something I couldn’t even name. The dream I had made it worse. I was trapped in a room with no escape, no way to breathe. But I had to go to church. If I didn’t, people would notice. Or maybe they wouldn’t. But I couldn’t let myself think like that. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I got there. What if I messed up? What if they all judged me? What if I couldn’t handle it? The moment I walked in, it felt like I was drowning in the air. It was thick, too much, too heavy. I scanned the room, hoping for something familiar, for some reassurance that I wasn’t completely alone. I found a few people. They were smiling, talking, living their lives. I waved at someone I knew, but they barely glanced at me. That was it. I felt my chest tighten. They didn’t care. They’d forgotten me. I wasn’t worth their attention. I sat down in the pew, hands trembling. My thoughts started spinning—what if they thought I was weird? What if they could see how much I was falling apart inside? I tried to focus on the sermon, but the words blurred into a dull hum. I couldn’t concentrate. Every sound, every movement felt magnified. Someone laughed behind me, and my mind immediately went to the worst possible place: they were laughing at me. I turned around, but they weren’t even looking my way. Still, the feeling stuck. The pastor’s voice changed. It became deeper, more forceful. It felt like it was directed at me, like he was speaking directly to my fears. The words didn’t matter; it was his tone that cut through me. It reminded me of every moment I’ve ever felt judged and abandoned. My stomach turned, and before I knew it, I was standing. I had to get away. I couldn’t breathe in there anymore. The doors slammed shut behind me, and I was left standing in the hallway. My hands were shaking. I should go back. But if I went back, I’d have to face them. I couldn’t bear the thought of their eyes on me. What if I ruined everything? I didn’t know how to handle this. I didn’t know how to be okay. People would be coming out soon. Would they ask if I was okay? Would they even care? The idea of them noticing me made my skin crawl. I couldn’t breathe. My heart was racing, my thoughts scattered, my body trembling with fear. Finally, I stepped outside. I felt disconnected, floating. But the fear was still there, lurking. What if I’d made a mistake? What if tomorrow, I felt empty again? I didn’t know. I never knew.

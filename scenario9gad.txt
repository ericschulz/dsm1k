I wasn’t sure why I even decided to go. I’d been thinking about it for days, trying to convince myself it would be fine. It was just a movie—how hard could it be? But all morning, my mind kept running through a million scenarios. What if I don’t like the movie? What if I make a fool of myself? What if something bad happens while I’m there, and I can’t handle it? The thoughts wouldn’t stop, and it felt like my body was in overdrive, constantly alert, even though I couldn’t pinpoint exactly why. I forced myself to go. I figured it was better than sitting at home, spiraling. The cinema wasn’t far, but as I walked, I couldn’t stop thinking about how everything could go wrong. My heart raced. What if someone was following me? What if I forgot my wallet? The lobby was crowded, and it felt like all eyes were on me, even though I knew logically they weren’t. I stood in line, palms sweating, stomach tight. The movie started, and I tried to settle in, but I kept checking my phone. What if I should’ve bought a different ticket? The people around me were laughing, and I couldn’t help but wonder if I was laughing at the right moments. What if I looked out of place? My thoughts kept racing, spinning from one worry to the next. I couldn’t focus on the screen. What if something happened to me in the theater? What if I got sick or fainted? What if I couldn’t leave in time if something went wrong? I kept telling myself it was just a movie. Every sound seemed amplified, every movement in the room felt like it was happening right next to me. The noise from the speakers felt overwhelming, like I was trapped in the middle of it all. I tried to focus on the plot, but it didn’t work. My mind kept jumping from one thing to another. What if I forgot to respond to that email? What if I made a mistake at work? The worries were relentless. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. It felt like a weight on my chest, and every deep breath I took didn’t seem to help. I kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would end. When the movie was over, I felt exhausted. I just wanted to get out. I walked quickly, my thoughts still racing. I felt a strange sense of relief when I finally stepped outside, but even then, the worry didn’t go away. It felt like there was always something I was missing, something that could go wrong at any moment. I just want to feel calm, even for a little while, without the constant overthinking. I got home. I want to be able to do things without this overwhelming sense that something terrible might happen.

I woke up just feeling off. It’s hard to explain, but it’s like I don’t know who I am. Some mornings, I wake up feeling energized, like I can take on the world. But today? Today, I feel empty. Heavy. Like I don’t even recognize myself. I stare at the ceiling, trying to figure out why, but there’s no reason. There never is. The feeling just takes over, and I have no control over it. I check my phone, hoping for some distraction. Nothing. No messages. No calls. The silence stings. I try to tell myself it’s fine, that no one hates me, that nothing happened overnight. But my brain won’t let it go. What if they’re mad at me? What if I said something wrong? What if I’m just not important to them anymore? The thought of being abandoned sits in my chest like a weight. I want to text someone—just to make sure they still care—but I don’t want to seem desperate. Even though, deep down, I am. I force myself out of bed, but everything already feels too much. Getting dressed, making breakfast, stepping outside—it all feels exhausting. On the way to work, I start overthinking again. I remember something my coworker said, something small, probably meaningless, but it keeps replaying. Were they being passive-aggressive? Were they annoyed with me? What if I made them hate me without realizing it? My emotions swing between anxiety, guilt, and anger. At the office, I feel restless, like my skin doesn’t fit right. I try to act normal, but it’s hard when my thoughts won’t shut up. I glance at my coworkers, searching for any sign that they’re mad at me. Someone doesn’t say hi when they walk past, and it stings more than it should. Did I do something? Are they avoiding me? The doubt twists in my stomach. During a meeting, someone slams a door, and I jump. For a second, I feel overwhelmed, like I could explode or break down at any moment. My emotions are too big for my body. I dig my nails into my palm just to stay grounded. When I speak, I feel like my voice doesn’t even sound like me. Am I too much? Am I not enough? I don’t even know anymore. By the end of the day, I’m exhausted. My thoughts have been a rollercoaster. I feel drained. On the way home, I suddenly feel this urge to do something reckless—just to feel something different. Maybe I should get wasted. Maybe I should text someone I shouldn’t. Maybe I should just disappear. The thought is tempting, but I push it down. I get home, collapse on the couch, and stare at the ceiling. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know if I’ll feel different tomorrow. But at least today is over.

I woke up drenched in sweat again. The dreams are never the same, yet they always are. Today, it was the sound of footsteps behind me, the shadow stretching long, the feeling of knowing but not knowing. I shook it off, or tried to, and forced myself out of bed. Sundays are for church. Routine is good, they say. I arrived early, hoping for an empty pew near the back. The space was familiar—stained glass casting fractured light, the murmurs of early arrivals settling in. It should be comforting, but the air was thick. Thick like before. I ran my fingers over the smooth wood of the pew, grounding myself. Deep breaths. Focus on the sermon. But then came the voice. A deep baritone from somewhere in the congregation. It wasn’t him, of course, but my body didn’t get the memo. My chest tightened. My palms went cold, then hot. The words of the sermon blurred, replaced by a roaring in my ears. I stared at the hymn book, gripping the edges, feeling the thin pages between my fingers. Just paper. Just a book. Not a weapon. I needed air. I stood too quickly, felt the eyes on me. Were they staring? No, just my imagination. Just my mind playing its tricks again. I walked—steadily, I hoped—toward the door. The hallway outside was dim and quiet, but the stillness didn’t help. The walls felt too close. I pressed my back against one, waiting for the feeling to pass. By the time I returned, the sermon was ending. People shook hands, exchanged pleasantries. I kept my head down, nodding where necessary. The pastor approached, his voice gentle, asking if I was all right. I forced a smile, said I was just feeling a little off today. He nodded, eyes kind but searching. I hate that look. That careful, measured concern. I don’t want to be pitied. Outside, the sun was too bright. I squinted, pulled my coat tighter though the air was warm. The parking lot felt endless. Each step stretched, too long, too heavy. I scanned the street as I walked to my car, eyes flicking from shadow to shadow, checking, always checking. It’s not him. It won’t be him. But the thought won’t leave. It clings like the scent of burning, like something seared into skin. At home, I locked the door. Checked twice. Sat at the kitchen table and tried to breathe. I should eat. Should do something normal. But the idea of food made my stomach twist. Instead, I stared at the clock, waiting for time to pass. I tell myself it’s just another Sunday. Just another morning. But the pews feel like trapdoors, the voices like echoes of something I can’t quite name. The past is supposed to be past. It isn’t. It lingers in doorways, in voices, in the weight of a hymn book in shaking hands. Tomorrow will be better. Maybe.

I woke up late today. The alarm went off, but I couldn’t get myself out of bed. I felt like the weight of everything was just pressing down on me. My stomach was in knots. I could feel it. There’s no reason for this, right? No one’s going to leave me, but I feel like if I don’t get things perfect, they’ll find a way to abandon me. I hate this feeling. I spent way too long getting ready. My reflection in the mirror… I can’t tell if I look okay. I keep shifting, looking from every angle. It’s like I don’t know who I am anymore. What’s the point? Why does it matter what I look like or what I wear? But I need to get it right today. It’s so exhausting. I put on that shirt I always wear when I’m trying 	to impress, but does it even make a difference? Maybe it makes me seem like I’ve got it all together. It’s so hard to keep up the act. I had an argument with Tom again. I felt this anger bubble up so quickly. Like, why does he always say things that hurt me? Doesn’t he care about how I feel? One minute, everything’s fine, and the next, I’m just screaming. And then the silence. The emptiness afterward. I feel so alone when we don’t talk. It’s like I can’t breathe. I almost sent that text. The one I keep drafting, the one that says, “I’m leaving. It’s over.” But I didn’t. Because I know he’s not going anywhere, right? Or maybe he will. He’s just like everyone else, waiting for the perfect moment to leave. I had lunch by myself. It’s like I’m drowning in this emptiness. I keep reaching out to fill the space, but nothing ever really works. Food doesn’t help, but I ate anyway. It wasn’t even satisfying. Just another thing to get through. I almost drove to the store after lunch, but I didn’t trust myself not to buy things I don’t need. Maybe I’ll do that tomorrow. Maybe I’ll feel better tomorrow. But then again, probably not. In the evening, I finally called my mom. I wasn’t going to, but I couldn’t stand the quiet anymore. She was so happy to hear from me. It made me feel a little better, but the whole time I felt like I was pretending. Like she wouldn’t accept me if she knew what was really going on in my head. Afterward, I just wanted to cry. I wanted to cut myself again. I just needed to let it out, but I couldn’t. So I started thinking about how I could end it all. I mean, I don’t want to, but sometimes I wonder. I’m so tired.

We are back from the theme park and I’m drained. I had been looking forward to this, but now that it’s over, I don’t think I enjoyed it. I don’t know what it was—maybe the crowds, or maybe I’m just getting old—but most of the day felt like I was trying to keep up, rather than actually being in the moment. The others were having fun, racing to the next attraction. I tried to stay involved, but I kept finding myself lost in thought. Each time we approached a new line, my mind would start racing—how long would we have to wait, how many people would be around us, would we be stuck in the sun too long? I caught myself glancing at my watch, even though I knew it didn’t really matter. It was hard to ignore the tension in my body. It wasn’t painful, just this constant weight, like a pressure in my chest that didn’t go away. The noise was another thing. There was music playing, people shouting, and the general hum of the park—it was too much at times. I’d find myself zoning out in the middle of conversations, distracted, not really hearing what was going on around me. We got in line for the Ferris wheel, and as we waited, I felt this subtle unease building. It wasn’t exactly fear, but it was there—this quiet anxiety, as if I couldn’t quite focus on what was in front of me. When the ride started, I tried to relax, but I could feel my stomach tighten. The view was beautiful, but I found myself thinking about how long we’d be up there, how long it would take to get off, whether it would feel like too much again. I realized that I’d been fidgeting a lot—just small movements, anything to keep my hands busy. I couldn’t sit still for long without feeling restless, like I needed to be somewhere else, anywhere else. When we stopped for a snack, I had to glance at the menu a few times before I realized I’d forgotten what I wanted. It was like I was going through the motions but not fully there. As the afternoon went on, the fatigue hit me. It wasn’t just the physical tiredness; it was something deeper. I had felt like I was holding my breath all day, waiting for something to go wrong, for the next stressful moment. I just wanted to go home. The idea of one last ride didn’t seem appealing. I was quiet on the way out. I didn’t really say much in the last hour. It was like my mind was elsewhere, and my body couldn’t keep up. I just kept thinking about how bad I felt, how drained I was. I wonder if I overthought it all. Maybe I need to spend more time alone.

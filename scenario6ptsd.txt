Dinner with Sarah was supposed to be normal. Just a simple meal, catching up. I told myself that all day, repeating it like a mantra. It’s just dinner. It’s just Sarah. But when I stepped inside the restaurant, my chest tightened so fast I almost turned around and left. It looked nothing like that place—different lighting, different layout, even different smells—but my body didn’t care. My body thought I was in danger. The clatter of silverware, the murmur of voices, the occasional burst of laughter—too much all at once. I scanned the room before I even realized I was doing it, my eyes darting to the doors, the windows, checking for exits. I knew it wasn’t rational. I knew that. But knowing and feeling are two different things. Sarah waved me over, smiling, oblivious to the way my hands were shaking. I forced myself to smile back, to walk normally, to sit without looking like I wanted to run. She started talking, something about her job, but I couldn’t focus. My ears had tuned in to something else—the sharp clang of a tray dropping behind me. My whole body flinched before I could stop it. My heart was pounding. I told myself to breathe, but my breath felt shallow, stuck. Sarah noticed. “Hey, are you okay?” she asked, her brow furrowing. I nodded too quickly. “Yeah, just… long day.” She kept talking, but I could barely hear her over the memories creeping in. The robbery was a year ago, but sometimes it feels like it’s still happening. The way the air had thickened with panic, the gunmetal gleam under the fluorescent lights. The shouting. The way my legs wouldn’t move at first, frozen in place, helpless. I gripped the edge of the table, grounding myself. This is not then. This is now. I pressed my heels into the floor, tried to count how many tiles were in the pattern beneath my feet. Anything to stop the images from flooding back. But then, a man at the next table laughed—a deep, sudden burst of noise—and my body reacted before my mind could catch up. A spike of adrenaline shot through me. My hands clenched into fists. My chest ached. I wasn’t in danger, but try telling my nervous system that. I must’ve gone quiet for too long because Sarah looked concerned. “Are you sure you’re alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” I forced a laugh, but even I could hear how thin it was. “I’m fine,” I said. “Just tired.” I spent the rest of dinner pretending to be present, but all I really did was endure. By the time we left, my muscles ached from how tense I’d been. Sarah hugged me goodbye, but I barely felt it. I walked home on autopilot. It was just dinner. Just Sarah. But my body doesn’t believe in just anything anymore.

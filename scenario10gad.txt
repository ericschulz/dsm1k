I woke up today with that sinking feeling in my chest. It’s like a heavy weight is sitting there, and I can’t shake it. The alarm went off, but I didn’t even need it to remind me that I have a million things to worry about. My mind was already racing through everything I need to do. I stayed in bed for too long, but getting up felt impossible. What if I mess something up today? What if I forget something important? My stomach churned as I changed outfits three times. Nothing felt right. Nothing ever feels right. Even the smallest decisions seem like they’ll have huge consequences, and I just can’t relax. I tried to eat something for breakfast, but my stomach was in knots. I wasn’t hungry, but I thought I should at least try. Of course, I started thinking about how I might overeat, how I might under-eat, and if it would affect my energy or mood. What if it throws my whole day off? What if I feel sluggish or anxious the entire day? I don’t want to feel like this. I just want to feel normal. When Tom talked to me, I couldn’t help but overthink everything he said. Was he upset with me? Was he annoyed by something I did or didn’t do? My mind couldn’t focus on anything else. I couldn’t get past those thoughts. What if he’s mad at me? What if I’ve already ruined everything? The constant worry makes it impossible to just be present. The whole day was like that—everything felt like it could fall apart at any second. At work, I kept double-checking everything I did, obsessing over the details. What if I made a mistake? What if it’s already too late to fix it? I feel like I can never do enough to be sure that everything’s fine. No matter how many times I check, there’s always something that doesn’t seem quite right. I just can’t stop. I went out to grab lunch, but it was hard to focus. Every person walking by felt like they were watching me. Judging me. My mind spirals, imagining all the things I could be doing wrong. Maybe my hair’s out of place, or my shoes don’t match, or I look weird eating alone. I feel like everyone notices every little thing I do wrong. In the afternoon, I just couldn’t stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong in the future. When I got home, I called my mom just to hear her voice. I needed someone to calm me down. But I couldn’t even focus on the conversation. My thoughts were all over the place. I kept apologizing for things I didn’t need to apologize for, like I always do. I’m so tired of feeling like this. The worry never stops.

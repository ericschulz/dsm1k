I thought coming to Berlin would be a good idea. A fresh start, a break from everything. But now I’m here, and I already feel like the ground beneath me is crumbling. The train ride was fine at first—I was excited, even. But then this overwhelming emptiness crept in. I tried to read, scroll through my phone, anything to distract myself, but nothing helped. I started wondering if I even exist when no one is around to remind me. I sent a text to Daniel, just something casual—“Hey, made it to Berlin!”—and waited. No reply. My stomach dropped. Does he even care? Maybe he’s ignoring me on purpose. Maybe he’s with someone else. By the time I arrived, I was already exhausted from my own thoughts. I stepped onto the platform and suddenly felt so alone. The city felt too big, too indifferent. I wanted to turn around, go home, curl up in my bed. But I had nowhere else to go. I found a coffee shop near the station and ordered something just to feel normal. The barista barely looked at me, and I wanted to scream. I feel invisible, like I don’t matter. I texted Daniel again: “Did I do something wrong?” Still nothing. My hands shook as I typed another message, this time angrier: “If you don’t care, just say so.” Still nothing. My chest tightened. He hates me. He’s leaving me. He probably never even liked me. I left the café abruptly, my heart pounding. I didn’t even drink my coffee. I felt like I was going to explode. I thought about running—just running down the street, away from this feeling—but where would I go? The idea of being alone tonight was unbearable. At check-in, the receptionist smiled politely, but I could tell she didn’t really care. No one does. I suddenly felt reckless. I wanted to do something—anything—to break out of this unbearable emptiness. I thought about going to a bar, finding someone, making them see me. But I knew how that would end. It always does. I finally got to my room and threw my bag down. I stared at my phone. Still no message from Daniel. My skin was buzzing with this horrible, restless energy. I gritted my teeth, pressing my nails into my palm until it hurt. It grounded me, at least a little. I can’t keep doing this. I just want to feel normal. I wish someone would tell me who I am. I don’t know anymore. One moment, I think I’m okay, and the next, I feel like I’m drowning. I can’t trust my own feelings—they change too fast, too intensely. I hate myself for being this way, for needing people so much but also pushing them away. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe Daniel will reply. Maybe someone will see me. Maybe I’ll finally feel real.
